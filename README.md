# Facebook Chat Bomber with GUI (Educational Use Only)

## Overview
This Python script uses the `fbchat` library and a simple graphical user interface (GUI) created with `PySimpleGUI` to send multiple messages to a Facebook friend. Users can input the recipient's name, the message to send, and the number of times to send the message. After clicking the "Ok" button, the script searches for the specified friend and sends the message the specified number of times. It also measures and prints the runtime for each message sent. This tool is intended for educational purposes and should be used responsibly and with the recipient's consent.
